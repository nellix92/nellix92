I am a newly graduated Junior Biomedical Engineer and I'm a junior Full-Stack Developer. The world of programming has always fascinated me in fact I am currently investing time and energy to increase my skills in both Java and .NET so that I can grow professionally and contribute significantly to software development. Both the course of study and my work experiences have contributed to develop my problem-solving skills, team work, flexibility and adaptability. I am a tenacious person who is inclined to sacrifice and pays attention to details. When faced with complicated situations, I can keep calm and find the best solution.  I adapt easily to new work contexts and have good resistance to stress. In my spare time I also love listening to music and traveling.
